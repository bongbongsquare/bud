# Bud

The aim of this project is to bring nature into a hyperreal world and represent it as a vibrant form in an audiovisual unity. This project imitates the process of blooming flowers but in an abstract way.
In general, nature and technology are isolated from each other. In this project, flower is the visual element, due to the fact that flower in particular is utilized as a nature element. Moreover, It always seems static, because the processes of blooming are too slow to be perceived. By using Time-lapse photography, the process of blooming becomes visible and it seems more vibrant, lively and rhythmic. In this project, the flower has been generated digitally from one real petal and it has been as it were, marvellously bloomed in an endless digital array.
Moreover, the rhythm of blooming changes, corresponding to the beat of subtly different subtle noises in four different forms. Those digital noises are intended to be devoid of recognisability. They are meaningless but exist everywhere, like the flowers open and fade quietly in space. However, Bud represents the dynamic and abstract form of nature, which clearly contrasts particular images of the real, natural world.
